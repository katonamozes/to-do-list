# to-do-list
It's an arduino based project that doesn't let you game unless you do all of your work. It is controlled by 2 buttons and it instructs a servo to turn your power strip on or off.

You can find the demo at: https://www.tinkercad.com/things/cw1HHmkV2Yy-to-do-list-demo

You should use this code for the Arduino mega 2456 in arduinoIDE. You should also install all the librarires necessery if you hacn't done that yet.
