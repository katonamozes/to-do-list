It's an arduino based project that doesn't let you game unless you do all of your work. It is controlled by 2 buttons and it instructs a servo to turn your power strip on or off.

You can find the demo at: [https://www.tinkercad.com/things/cw1HHmkV2Yy-to-do-list-demo](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/cw1HHmkV2Yy-to-do-list-demo?sharecode=IhWjQwsmsvmyRTUtUrxrVQV25H9BzTjnFC0mVSmOX1U)

You should use this code for the Arduino mega 2456 in arduinoIDE. You should also install all the librarires necessery if you hacn't done that yet. 

If you want me to add more questions just send a message to me at semmis558@gmail.com.

The code for the Arduino UNO is made with the use of a 4 pin (I2C) lcd (liquicrystal_I2C).
The code for the Arduino Mega 2456 is made with the use of a 16 pin (HD44780) lcd (liquicrystal).
